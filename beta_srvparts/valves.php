		<li>Position the coach on a level flat surface, drive the coach onto approximately 4&quot; blocks, and set the park brake. You may drive the coach over a work pit and chock the front wheels and block off adequate space at the rear of the coach to work.</li>
		<li>Deflate the air springs using the dump valve switch in the coach, you may also need to drain the air tank, by depressing the brake pedal multiple times.</li>
		<li>Using a hose cutting tool, cut the air lines as close to the bag as workable with a <b>clean and precise</b> 90&deg; cut. The &quot;B&quot; side of the CCV valve should be oriented toward the air spring (air-bag). Note: possible leaks can occur if the air line is not cut precisely or not clean of all debris. Use a soap and water solution to clean and lube the hose before installing into CCV valve.</li>
		<li>Install the motion control unit in place, push tubing firmly into each port of the control unit, the tubing will lock into place. <b>Make sure the hose is pushed in as far as possible into the CCV valve!</b> The CCV valve must be mounted in such a way as to not to create side load on the hoses. If there is a strain on the hose, it could create a leak.</li>
		<li>Start engine inflate the air springs and check for leaks by spraying the fittings with a water and soap mixture.</li>
