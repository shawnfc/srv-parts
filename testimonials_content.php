<p style="padding:0 150px;">Hi Jim, just a note to let you know wife and I are very pleased with the ride improvement your shocks have made in our 2004 45' Monaco Signature. I had a chance to drive one of the new 45' coaches this week and must say the ride of our 11 year old coach with your shocks (installed two weeks ago) is far better than that of the new coach.</p>

	The new shocks work well. 527 miles back to Carson City over every type of road except gravel, from smooth new asphalt to rutted, potholed and tar-stripped concrete. Best description is the coach is now more sure-footed, particularly on bad concrete/rough roads, and at higher speed of 70-75.  Definitely reduces the driving drama at freeway speeds.

<p style="padding:0 150px;">hey jim, first I want to say thank you to you and scott for a fine engineered product. I was getting motion sickness from the ride of our vesta not to mention the stuff in the cabinets were never where we put them after traveling. we are enjoying the very enhanced and controlled ride of our coach. installation wasn't that bad either. I am an auto mechanic so have the facility and equipment, wouldn't recommend in the driveway! instructions were right on the money. can't believe roadmaster didn't do this from the start. also the after sale support was like no other I have dealt with. these guys are top of the game! thanks again, mark and monica...Louisiana.</p>
