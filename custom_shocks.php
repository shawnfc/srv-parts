	<p>Source Engineering lnc. has collaborated with Bilstein to develop the shock absorbers for all Roadmaster Chassis. The shocks are carefully tuned for each chassis. After months of design, computer modeling, fabrication and testing, Bilstein has developed a state of the art mono-tube shock absorber tuned for each Roadmaster application.</p>
	<p>Available for Monaco, Holiday Rambler, Beaver and Safari motorhomes using a variety of Roadmaster chassis, these shock absorbers will improve ride quality and handling to an exceptional degree. These are the same shock absorbers used in our custom ride enhancement kits, and this is not a one size fits all solution - these shocks are tuned to the individual chassis type used on each particular coach model. Order a set today and start actually enjoying driving your rig in time for the upcoming season!</p>
